# SPELL WRITER APP - specifications

# Overview

**Spell Writer** is a minimalist educational mobile application designed to help children (ages 5-8) learn to write by listening to spoken words and typing them on a magical grimoire. The app uses a wizard/magic theme to make learning engaging, with a friendly ghost character guiding the child through the experience.

**Core Value Proposition:** Transform the potentially frustrating experience of learning to spell into a magical, playful adventure where mistakes are funny rather than discouraging.

The planning and implementation was made with the bmad_method.
