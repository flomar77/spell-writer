**Spell Writer** is a minimalist educational mobile application designed to help children (ages 5-8) learn to write by listening to spoken words and typing them on a magical grimoire. The app uses a wizard/magic theme to make learning engaging, with a friendly ghost character guiding the child through the experience.

The app is built using the [BMAD Method](https://docs.bmad-method.org/) and Claude Code.
