1. Prompt to build a prompt_plan.md but only use new requirements
```
Read the attached new_requirements.md and generate a prompt_plan.md with TDD-focused
implementation steps.

For each feature in the spec:
1. First prompt: Write failing tests
2. Second prompt: Implement to make tests pass
3. Third prompt: Refactor if needed

Format each prompt like this:
- [ ] N. [TEST] Write tests for [feature] that verify [expected behavior]
- [ ] N+1. [IMPL] Implement [feature] to pass all tests
- [ ] N+2. [CHECK] Run full test suite and commit changes

Include these phases:
- Project setup (dependencies, structure, tooling)
- Core features (one at a time, test-first)
- Integration (putting features together)
- Polish (error handling, edge cases, docs)

Make prompts atomic - each should be completable in one Claude Code session.
